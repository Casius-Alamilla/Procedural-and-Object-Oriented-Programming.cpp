Write a C++ program that will simulate a lottery.
Part 1:
1. Prompt the user to choose 3 numbers that he thinks will be the lottery numbers (between 0 and
    100, 100 is not included).
2. Store those numbers in 3 integer variables: num1, num2, num3.
3. Write a loop that will simulate a lottery commission choosing 3 random numbers. This loop will
    continue to run until the 3 numbers that the user chose gets selected. This loop will keep track of how
    many iterations it takes for the loop to generate those 3 numbers.
4. Output the number of iterations it took for the program to generate those numbers


Part 2:
Modify the Lottery Simulator such that it will continue to prompt the user to input 3 numbers
that are in the range of 0 – 99 (inclusive) until the user enters 3 numbers that are in that range.
The loop will output which numbers were out of range
