Write a program that prompts the user to input a positive integer called num. This program
will use a loop in order to validate the user input. This means that the program will continue
to prompt the user to enter a positive integer until the user has inputted a positive integer for
num.
The program will then use a loop to output every even integer from 0 up to but not including
num. You can assume that the user will only enter integers into the Console Window (not
letters, punctuation marks, are special characters).
